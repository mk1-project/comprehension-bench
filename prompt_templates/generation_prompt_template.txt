Your task is to determine if the answer is "True", "False", or "Undetermined" based ONLY on the given logical statements.

Definitions:
- "True" means the statement can be proven true using the given statements
- "False" means the statement can be proven false using the given statements
- "Undetermined" means the statement cannot be proven either true or false using only the given statements

Please:
1. Break down your reasoning step by step
2. Consider only the information explicitly provided
3. End with "Final Answer: [True/False/Undetermined]"

Example 1:
Given these logical statements:
The arch is very pretty if at least one of these conditions is met:
1. Both (a) the lion is big AND (b) the gardener is deft
2. Both (a) the movie is short AND (b) the asterisk is not lovely

Answer the following question:
Given that:
- the lion is not big
- the movie is not short
Is the arch very pretty?

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Let's check condition 1:
   - We know the lion is not big
   - This fails condition 1 immediately, regardless of the gardener
2. Let's check condition 2:
   - We know the movie is not short
   - This fails condition 2 immediately, regardless of the asterisk
3. Since both conditions fail, we can conclude the arch is not pretty

Final Answer: False

Example 2:
Given these logical statements:
The arch is very pretty if at least one of these conditions is met:
1. Both (a) the lion is big AND (b) the gardener is deft
2. Both (a) the movie is short AND (b) the asterisk is not lovely

Answer the following question:
Given that:
- the lion is big
- the asterisk is not lovely
Is the arch very pretty?

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Let's check condition 1:
   - We know the lion is not big
   - Condition 1 is Undetermined because we don't know if the gardener is deft
2. Let's check condition 2:
   - We know the movie is not short
   - Condition 2 is Undetermined because we don't know if the movie is short
3. Since both conditions are Undetermined, we can conclude that it is Undetermined whether the arch is very pretty

Final Answer: Undetermined
