Here is the question:

{query}

Here is the expected answer:

{answer}

Here is the model's response:

{response}

Here is the expected answer, again: {answer}

Evaluate if the model's final answer matches the expected answer. Focus on the final answer of the model, not the intermediate steps or reasoning.Use these equivalence rules:
- "true" = "True" = "yes" = "correct"
- "false" = "False" = "no" = "incorrect"
- "undetermined" = "unknown" = "unclear"

Respond with ONLY "Yes" if the model's final answer matches the expected answer, or "No" if it doesn't match.
